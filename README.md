# Bingo

A simple game of Bingo that you can play alone, or with friends! (multiple devices in a single room are required)

To play alone, simply click "Single Player" after starting. You will be unable to click any of the numbers on the 
Bingo board until they are called.

To play with friends, select "Multi Player" after starting. You can click any of the numbers freely, but that's not how
you play this version. One person will be in charge of 'calling', another person will keep track of the numbers called,
and you play it like you would play normal Bingo.
